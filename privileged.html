        which has registered for it before. Those events are different from DOM
        events in the sense that they are always originated by the system and
        that if the targeted application is not currently running, it will be
        started.<br>
        In addition, unhandled messages will stay in a queue.

          Some applications might be interested in getting some events even if
          they are not running and want to be woken up if such event is sent
          while they are asleep.<br>
          In addition, when the application is being woken, it needs to know as
          soon as possible why it has been disturbed to be able to show the
          appropriate interface.<br>
          Finally, the capability of being woken should be transparent to the
          application.

          The <dfn>type of system message</dfn> identifies a category of system

          Application are able to register and handle system messages based on
          their types. There is no exhaustive list of system messages type. Any
          specification can create a new type of system message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each application has a <dfn>pool of messages</dfn> for each <a>type
          of system message</a>. Every time a system message is sent to an
          application, if there is no handler for that message's type, the UA
          MUST add the message to the pool of messages used for that type.<br>
          The UA MAY, for memory optimization, discard old messages if the pool
          becomes too big or if the messages are too old.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a UA is required to <dfn>fire a system message</dfn> of a given

          defined, the UA MUST add the message to the <a>pool of messages</a>;
          </li>
          <li>Otherwise, if the application is not running, the UA MUST add the

          Some API might allow the application to access sensitive parts of the
          hardware or sensitive information. To prevent applications to access
          them, some APIs might require one or more permissions. For example,
          for an application to be allowed to access your geolocation
          information, it has to be granted the <i>geolocation</i> permission.

          Permission declaration

        <p>
          An application SHOULD define all permissions it is going to use in
          the <a>application manifest</a>. The UA MAY automatically grant some
          permissions at install-time or ask the user to grant some
          applications. However, MAY, in addition or alternatively, ask the
          user to grant permissions at run-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user MUST be able to revoke a granted permission or grant a
          denied permission at any time.

            Use cases
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some applications require access to APIs which, if abused, may
            cause significant damage to the end user's services, data or
            devices. For example, an API allowing the use of SMS could be
            misused by a malicious application to send unwanted premium-rate
            messages costing the user money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the impact of using a malicious application with these
            privileges is higher, additional security mechanisms and processes
            are necessary to minimize the additional risk they present. This
            might include, for example, mandatory review of applications or
            certification. A simple user-authorized permission system is
            considered insufficient: users could be tricked into granting a
            malicious application access to inappropriate APIs, services or
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a complement to permissioning, this specification defines a
            <em>privileged</em> class of application. Applications which are
            not privileged will not be able to access potentially dangerous
            APIs.

          <p>
            An application is said to be a <dfn>privileged application</dfn> if
            the origin installing the application is trusted by the UA and the
            origin installing the application considers the application to be
            trustworthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            A UA SHOULD have the public key of all installation origins it
            considers to be trusted.

            Marking an application privileged
          </h2>
          <p>
            A <a>hosted application</a> MUST be recognized as marked privileged
            by the installation origin if the <a>application manifest</a> is
            signed by the installation origin's private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <a>packaged application</a> MUST be recognized as marked
            privileged by the installation origin if the package is signed by
            the installation origin's private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            In both cases, the application SHOULD be considered as privileged
            by the UA if the UA considers the installation origin as trusted,
            following the chain of trust mentioned above.

            Security considerations
          </h2>
          <p>
            UA should keep in mind that a signed package is way more secure
            than a signed manifest. A correctly signed package can only be
            compromised if the private key has been compromised or the
            cryptographic algorithm. A UA should not trust an installation
            origin if it does not trust its ability to keep safe its private
            key.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hands, a signed manifest only proves that the
            application is genuinely trusted (if the private key was not
            compromised nor the cryptographic algorithm). Anything else can be
            compromised given that it lives in the Internet. There is no need
            to list all possible attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important difference between a <a>packaged application</a> and a
            <a>hosted application</a> is the ability to review the code. Any
            permission granted to a <a>packaged application</a> will be granted
            to the code inside the package only. That means trusting such
            application is way easier after a code review, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, code review for <a>packaged application</a>s could be
            avoided if the installation origin trusts enough an application
            developer. Such developer could get all its <a>packaged
            application</a>s trusted without too much risk for the users.<br>
            The same thing could be done for <a>hosted application</a> except
            that it would be recommended to make sure that the developer has
            strong server security or would not risk any security flaw on their
            servers.

        </p>
        <p>
          An application is <dfn>running</dfn> when it has been launched by the
          UA and has not been put in <a>paused</a>. A <a>running</a>
          application can transition to <a>paused</a> or <a>terminated</a>
          states.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>running</a> application transitions to a <a>paused</a> state,
          the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>pause</code> on
          the <a>Application</a> object before switching its state.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>running</a> application transitions to a <a>terminated</a>
          state, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>terminate</code> on the <a>Application</a> object before
          shutting down the application.
        </p>
        <p>
          An application is <dfn>paused</dfn> when the UA stops the execution
          of an application without terminating it. A <a>paused</a> application
          SHOULD have all its scripts no longer running, such as rendering,
          parsing, processing media files and any action that requires CPU and
          memory or would distract the user. A <a>paused</a> application can
          transition to <a>running</a> or <a>terminated</a> states.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>paused</a> application transitions to a <a>running</a> state,
          the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named <code>resume</code> on
          the <a>Application</a> object after changing its state.
        </p>
        <p>
          An application is <dfn>terminated</dfn> when the application has been
          stopped and is no longer loaded in the system. The state of a
          <a>terminated</a> application can only be changed to <a>running</a>
          if the application is launched again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>terminated</a> application transitions to a <a>running</a>

          The specification currently assumes that one will save important when
          paused so there is no terminate event when transitioning from pause
          to terminate.

          Do we have real use cases for <code>launch</code>?<br>
          Is firing before <code>load</code> a hard thing to do?

          Consequences of visibility
        </h2>
        <p>
          While an application is running, it can be part or fully hidden. The
          visibility events described in [[!PAGE-VISIBILITY]] MUST be sent when
          the visibility status of the application changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, when the application becomes fully hidden, the UA MAY
          put the application in a <a>paused</a> state.

          Use cases
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some methods want to return a value or do an action but can't do it
          synchronously, most of the time for performance reasons. In that
          case, most of those methods will use a callback mechanism to inform
          the caller of the success or the failure of the action.<br>
          However, this callback mechanism makes the code barely readable and
          there is no common pattern used by all API in the Web Platform.<br>
          <a>DOMRequest</a> intend to be used instead of those callbacks to
          make those APIs more developer-friendly and help code readability.

        <h2>
          Definition
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <a>DOMRequest</a> interface is intended to be used by
          asynchronous methods that want to return something after performing
          an action or simply want to inform the caller that the action is
          done. It returned request can also be used to inform that an error
          happened during the operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>DOMRequest</a> has three state. It is whether
          <code>pending</code>, <code>success</code> or <code>error</code>.<br>
          The initial state of a <a>DOMRequest</a> MUST be
          <code>pending</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives a <a>success message</a> while in the
          <code>pending</code> state, its state MUST change to
          <code>success</code> and SHOULD NOT change afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives an <a>error message</a> while in the
          <code>pending</code> state, its state MUST change to
          <code>error</code> and SHOULD NOT change afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a <a>DOMRequest</a> receives a <a>success message</a> or an
          <a>error message</a> while not in the <code>pending</code> state, the
          message MUST be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>success message</dfn> SHOULD be sent to the <a>DOMRequest</a>
          when the operation is successfully terminated. The message MAY
          contain a value which MUST be used by the <code>result</code>
          attribute. If the message does not contain a value, <i>null</i> MUST
          be used instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as a <a>success message</a> is received,
          <code>readyState</code> MUST return <code>done</code>,
          <code>result</code> MUST return the received value or <i>null</i> as
          explained above and the object MUST NOT change its state and MUST,
          therefore, ignore all following <a>success message</a> and <a>error
          message</a>.<br>
          Finally, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>success</code> on the object
        </p>
        <p>
          An <dfn>error message</dfn> SHOULD be sent to the <a>DOMRequest</a>
          when the operation has failed. The message MAY contain a value which
          MUST be a <a>DOMError</a> object and MUST be used by the
          <code>error</code> attribute. If the message does not contain a
          value, the UA SHOULD find the most appropriate <a>DOMError</a> that
          represents the failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as an <a>error message</a> is received,
          <code>readyState</code> MUST return <code>done</code>,
          <code>error</code> MUST return the received value the most
          appropriate error value as explained above and the object MUST NOT
          change its state and MUST, therefore, ignore all following <a>success
          message</a> and <a>error message</a>.<br>
          Finally, the UA MUST <a>fire a simple event</a> named
          <code>error</code> on the object.
