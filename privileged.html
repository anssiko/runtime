      This specification extends <em>Runtime and Security Model for Web
      Applications</em> [[!SYSAPPS-RUNTIME]] with APIs exposed to

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some applications require access to APIs which, if abused, may
        cause significant damage to the end user's services, data or
        devices. For example, an API allowing the use of SMS could be
        misused by a malicious application to send unwanted premium-rate
        messages costing the user money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the impact of using a malicious application with these
        privileges is higher, additional security mechanisms and processes
        are necessary to minimize the additional risk they present. This
        might include, for example, mandatory review of applications or
        certification. A simple user-authorized permission system is
        considered insufficient: users could be tricked into granting a
        malicious application access to inappropriate APIs, services or
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a complement to permissioning, this specification defines a
        <em>privileged</em> class of application. Applications which are
        not privileged will not be able to access potentially dangerous
        APIs.

          each the action happened.<br>
          The application events are always sent asynchronously, do not bubble
          and are not cancelable.

        <p>
          There are currently two types of Application Events:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <dfn>install</dfn> is sent when an application is installed.
            <code>application</code> MUST represent the installed application.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>uninstall</dfn> is sent when an application is uninstalled.
            <code>application</code> MUST represent the uninstalled
            application.

            An application is said to be a <dfn>privileged application</dfn> if
            the origin installing the application is trusted by the UA and the
            origin installing the application considers the application to be
            trustworthy.
          </p>
          <p>
            A UA SHOULD have the public key of all installation origins it
            considers to be trusted.

          <p>
            A <a>hosted application</a> MUST be recognized as marked privileged
            by the installation origin if the <a>application manifest</a> is
            signed by the installation origin's private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <a>packaged application</a> MUST be recognized as marked
            privileged by the installation origin if the package is signed by
            the installation origin's private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            In both cases, the application SHOULD be considered as privileged
            by the UA if the UA considers the installation origin as trusted,
            following the chain of trust mentioned above.

            Security considerations
          </h2>
          <p>
            UA should keep in mind that a signed package is way more secure
            than a signed manifest. A correctly signed package can only be
            compromised if the private key has been compromised or the
            cryptographic algorithm. A UA should not trust an installation
            origin if it does not trust its ability to keep safe its private
            key.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hands, a signed manifest only proves that the
            application is genuinely trusted (if the private key was not
            compromised nor the cryptographic algorithm). Anything else can be
            compromised given that it lives in the Internet. There is no need
            to list all possible attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important difference between a <a>packaged application</a> and a
            <a>hosted application</a> is the ability to review the code. Any
            permission granted to a <a>packaged application</a> will be granted
            to the code inside the package only. That means trusting such
            application is way easier after a code review, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, code review for <a>packaged application</a>s could be
            avoided if the installation origin trusts enough an application
            developer. Such developer could get all its <a>packaged
            application</a>s trusted without too much risk for the users.<br>
            The same thing could be done for <a>hosted application</a> except
            that it would be recommended to make sure that the developer has
            strong server security or would not risk any security flaw on their
            servers.

            CSP Policy

          <section class="note">
            The following sub-section assumes that a <a>privileged
            application</a> can only be a <a>packaged application</a>. This
            needs to be updated.
          </section>
          <p>
            The following CSP policy MUST apply to all <a>privileged
            application</a>s [[!CSP]]:<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>default-src *; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
            style-src 'self'</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            This puts the following restrictions on web pages part of a
            <a>privileged application</a>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scripts can only be loaded from the package;
            </li>
            <li>Scripts can not use data:-URIs;
            </li>
            <li>Inline scripts can not be used;
            </li>
            <li>eval() can not be used. Neither can eval-like functions like
            setTimeout or "new Function". setTimeout can still be used as long
            as the first argument is a Function object rather than a string;
            </li>
            <li>onXXX attributes can't be used in the markup of pages. However,
            using the associated <a>EventHandler</a> is doable. For example:
            myElement.onXXX = someFunction;
            </li>
            <li>&lt;object&gt;, &lt;embed&gt; and &lt;applet&gt; are fully
            disabled. In other words, plugins won't work at all. Including
            flash.
            </li>
            <li>CSS can only be loaded from the package. Inline CSS is however
            allowed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This does not restrict any of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;iframe&gt;s can still point to any URL;
            </li>
            <li>Images can still be loaded from anywhere. Including when loaded
            using an &lt;img&gt; element, when using CSS background images or
            when using other types of CSS images;
            </li>
            <li>Media (audio and video) can still be loaded from anywhere;
            </li>
            <li>Network connections can still be opened anywhere using
            data-centric APIs like XMLHttpRequest or WebSocket.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is no way for <a>privileged application</a>s to relax this
            policy.
